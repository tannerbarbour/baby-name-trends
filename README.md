Assessment Task for Ansible Health

Response: I read in the 2007 and 2020 SSA baby name datasets and ranked all names by birth count within each sex for 2007. Then, I merged the two datasets and filtered for names that were highly ranked in 2007 but had dropped out of the top 100 by 2020. I sorted these dropped names by their 2007 rank and selected the top 10 male and top 10 female names that saw significant decline.
